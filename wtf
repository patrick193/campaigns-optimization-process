1. Get campaign stats from the NUVIAD API - sometimes return an error like
    { error:
       { name: 'syncError',
         message: 'Something went wrong while mocking this request. Please try again in some time and contact support if the issue persists.' } }

2. Update NUVIAD API NOT WORKING!!! WTF????? how to finish a task???
    {
        "error": {
            "name": "mockRequestNotFoundError",
            "message": "We were unable to find any matching requests for this method type and the mock path, '/campaigns/ceecf7e1-a24d-428b-b013-8526e848ce3d/update_bid', in your collection."
        }
    }

3. How to calculate a new_bid ? Excuse me, but where I should get an old_bid value?? And, again, how to calc a new bid???
